# Predicting Rice Yields Using Machine Learning Approaches Through Satellite Imagery

The idea of this study came from the curiousity of investigating the use of satellite imagery in prediction the crop yield in Malaysia. In this study, satellite imagery data is being used to predict the rice yields in Sekinchan, a small town in Malaysia, through machine learning. 

The prediction system is developed using Google Colab, with the satallite data taken from Google Earth Engine data catalogue where it is accessed through the Google Earth Engine Python API. The machine learning algorithms used in this study are random forest regression and long short-term memory (LSTM).
